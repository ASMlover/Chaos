# **Chaos: Morden C++ Library**
***

## **What is `Chaos`?**
  **Chaos is a basic library of C++2a components.**

  * A collection of C++ class libraries.
  * Written in efficient, mordern, 100% `ANSI/ISO Standand C++`.
  * Based on and complementing the `C++ Standand Library/STL`.
  * Highly portable and available on many different platforms.
  * Open Source, licensed under [The FreeBSD License](https://www.freebsd.org/copyright/freebsd-doc-license.html).

## **Building**
  Chaos use following software as its dependencies:

  * [CMake](https://cmake.org/) as a general build tool.

  To build and run unittests please proceed with the steps below:

  * Create directory called `build` or `cmake-build` in Chaos source directory.
  * Change to `build` or `cmake-build` directory and run `cmake ..` command to configure your build.
  * On Windows, build the solution found in the build directory. On Linux or macOS run `make` from the build directory.
```shell
# On Linux or macOS
$ mkdir cmake-build && cd cmake-build
$ cmake ..
$ make -j
# Run unittests on Linux or macOS
$ ./bin/chaos.test

# On Windows
# Setting the building environment(VS2019), such as:
\> %VS2019PATH%\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat # just for x64
\> %VS2019PATH%\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars32.bat # just for x32
# Building Chaos using command
\> mkdir cmake-build & cd cmake-build
\> cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
\> nmake
# Run unittests on Windows
\> .\bin\chaos.test.exe

# Building Chaos using VS2019 solution
\> mkdir cmake-build & cd cmake-build
\> cmake .. # for x86
\> cmake -A x64 .. # for x64
\> msbuild ChaosPROJ.sln
```
